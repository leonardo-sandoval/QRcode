## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

For this first HTML/CSS mini-project I reinforced the basic fundamentals learned from SuperSimpleDev's ["HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc) course found on YouTube. I then reworked the component to be more responsive and accessible, as well as use proper HTML semantics and landmarks.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to complete more of these mini-projects to further strengthen my fundamentals. I also intend to learn more complex techniques and tools, allowing me to take on more advanced projects.
